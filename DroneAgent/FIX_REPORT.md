# Twitter Automation Suite - Fix Report

## Issue Identified
When clicking the "Main Twitter Agent" button in the launcher, the application was incorrectly launching the launcher itself again, rather than the main application executable.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was found in the `launch_app` method in `main_launcher.py`. The method was looking for executables in the current directory rather than in the "dist" subdirectory where they are located after building.

Specifically, the problematic code was:
```python
# Look for exe in dist directory first
exe_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), exe_name)
if not os.path.exists(exe_path):
    # Try current directory
    exe_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), exe_name)
```

Both search paths were identical, which meant if the executable wasn't found in the current directory, it would check the same directory again, which would fail.

## Fix Applied
1. Updated the `launch_app` method in `main_launcher.py` to correctly look for executables in the "dist" subdirectory:
```python
# Look for exe in dist directory first
exe_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "dist", exe_name)
if not os.path.exists(exe_path):
    # Try current directory
    exe_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), exe_name)
```

2. Created an alternative launcher batch file `Launch_Fixed.bat` which directly launches the correct executables from the dist directory.

## Workaround
While attempting to rebuild the launcher executable, we encountered permission issues with the build process. To work around this, we created a simple batch file launcher that:

1. Presents a menu to select which application to launch
2. Changes to the dist directory
3. Directly launches the correct executable

## Next Steps
For a complete fix, we recommend:

1. Close all applications and restart your system to clear any file locks
2. Delete the build directory
3. Run the build script again to rebuild all executables with the updated launcher code

## Using the Fix
To use the workaround fix:

1. Run `Launch_Fixed.bat` in the main application directory
2. Select the application you want to run from the menu
3. The correct executable will launch from the dist directory

This will ensure that clicking "Main Twitter Agent" launches the actual main application rather than another launcher window.
